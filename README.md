# dangerZoneApp
This app is designed as a preventative measure to police brutality and general danger. The app functions with two buttons to press when in danger and a network addition. 
A user’s “network” consists of three phone numbers. Once a user adds their network they are able to press one of two buttons. The button labeled “law enforcement” allows 
a user to send three sms messages to their network letting them know that the user has been reprimanded by the police and sharing the user’s location. The button also opens 
the camera on the user’s phone so that the user can record their interaction with the police. The second button notifies the user’s network of their location and sends a 
message that the user is near suspicious activity. For this app I utilized Android’s extensive permission library to send the texts and open the user’s camera and I used 
shared preferences and a custom “PhoneBook” class to keep track of the user’s safety network. I hope to add a database where users can record their experiences and the media 
(videos) associated with them. This app is on my github and is being deployed to the playstore as well.
